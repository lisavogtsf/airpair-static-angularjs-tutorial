My version of the Airpair Angular JS Tutorial
====================

Something may have changed, so the tutorial was a bit hard to follow. I resorted to copying over the tutorial github files and personalizing them a bit to make sure I understood how things were put together. This was useful for understanding how to do static templating in Angular, as I had been doing it in Rails or Node, and I wanted to be able to do it without a server.
